    The son of a sanctioned Russian oil executive described as Vladimir Putin's "right hand man" has died, according to reports.<br>

Ivan Sechin, 35, reportedly died on 5 February after complaining that he was "suffocating", according to the Telegram channel VChK-OGPU.<br>

"The man fell on the bed and lost consciousness," the report said.<br>

"Those around him carried Ivan to the floor and tried to provide resuscitation."<br>

The channel said when the ambulance arrived Mr Sechin was pronounced dead at the scene. <br>

A source told the news outlet that the official cause of death was a "detached blood clot".<br>

The independent Russian news outlet Mediazona reports the first to write about Mr Sechin's death Leonid Nevzlin, the former manager of the Russian oil and gas company YUKOS, who described the death as a "strange coincidence."<br>

Mr Nevzlin is a Russian-Israeli oligarch who renounced his Russian citizenship in 2022 after Russia's invasion.<br>

A translation of Mr Nevzlin's statement on Facebook reads: "It may be hard to believe, but I sincerely sympathise with the father who lost his child."<br>

He added: "My condolences to the Sechin family, who are forced to hide their grief."<br>

Ivan Sechin is the son of Igor Sechin, a long-time ally of Vladimir Putin and the boss of Rosneft, one of the largest oil companies in Russia.<br>

He is regarded as one of the most powerful people in Russia, acting as deputy prime minister under Mr Putin from 2008 to 2012, and maintains strong connections to the countryâ€™s intelligence agencies.<br>

Mr Sechin was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 following the war in Ukraine.<br>

  Kim Jong Un liked Aurus limousine when he visited Russia

  <p>
    We reported earlier that Vladimir Putin had gifted Kim Jong Un with a Russian Aurus limousine "for his personal use" (see post at 6.52am).<br>

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has now said the Russian leader gave Mr Kim the car because the North Korean leader had liked the vehicle when he visited Russia.<br>

For context: In September, while visiting Russia's space launch station in Russia, Mr Kim inspected the Aurus Senat limousine and was invited by the Russian leader to climb into the back seat.<br>

Mr Kim is believed to be an avid car enthusiast and has been spotted travelling in luxury models including the Mercedes-Maybach S600, Rolls-Royce Phantom and Lexus LX 570.
